Complete Kubernetes operator implementation that integrates Resend email service with the Milo platform for automated email delivery.

### Architecture

*   **Controller Manager**: Reconciles Email CRDs by fetching templates, rendering content, and sending emails via Resend
    
*   **Webhook Server**: Processes Resend delivery events (sent/delivered/bounced) and updates Email status
    
*   **Email Provider Interface**: Abstracted email provider supporting multiple backends (currently Resend)
    

### Key Features

*   **Template Rendering**: Dynamic email content using EmailTemplate CRDs with variable substitution
    
*   **Idempotency**: Uses Email UID as idempotency key to prevent duplicate sends
    
*   **Status Tracking**: Kubernetes conditions for email delivery states (Pending/Delivered/Failed)
    
*   **Event Correlation**: Indexes emails by providerID for efficient webhook event processing
    
*   **Priority Support**: Configurable retry delays based on email priority
    
*   **Security**: SVIX webhook signature verification for event authenticity
    

### Components

*   Dual-mode deployment: controller manager + separate webhook server
    
*   RBAC for Email, EmailTemplate, and User CRD access
    
*   Metrics and health endpoints with TLS support
    
*   Leader election for HA deployments
    

Provides reliable, observable email delivery for the Milo notification system.
